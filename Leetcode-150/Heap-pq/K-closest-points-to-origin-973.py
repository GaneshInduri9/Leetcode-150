    Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point 
    on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
    The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (
    i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).You may return the answer in any order. 
    The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

        The brute force way would be to find the distance of each point and store them in some data 
        structure so that we can sort them and return the k closest elements to origin.
        A better way would be to use a heap, the intualtion behind putting - negative values 
        is so that when ever we see a smaller element we would want to pop the larger element first
        when the size exceeds more than k (the larger elements comes in front)
